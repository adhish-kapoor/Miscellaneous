Q Which of the following describes the Builder pattern correctly?
- Builder pattern (Creational pattern) builds a complex object using simple objects and using a step by step approach. This builder is independent of other objects.

Q Which of the following pattern is used when creation of object directly is costly?
- Prototype pattern is used when creation of object directly is costly.
It is used to create a duplicate object.

Q Which of the following describes the Chain of Responsibility pattern correctly?
- Chain of responsibility pattern creates a chain of receiver objects for a request.
ATM machine is an example.

Q Which of the following pattern is used to reduce communication complexity between multiple objects or classes?
- Mediator pattern is used to reduce communication complexity between multiple objects or classes.

Q Which of the following describes the Strategy pattern correctly?
- In Strategy pattern (Behavioral pattern), a class behavior or its algorithm can be changed at run time.
Also known as the policy pattern is a behavioral software design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm at runtime. 
Instead of implementing a single algorithm directly, code receives run-time instructions as to which in a family of algorithms to use.

Q Which of the following pattern is used to separate application's concerns?
- MVC pattern is used to separate application's concerns.

Q Which of the following pattern creates object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created object using a common interface?
- Factory Pattern (Creational design pattern) creates object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created object using a common interface.

Q Which type of design patterns are specifically concerned with the presentation tier?
- J2EE Design Patterns are specifically concerned with the presentation tier.

Q Which of the following is the correct list of entities of Intercepting pattern?
- Filter, Filter Chain, Target, Filter Manager, Client are the entities of Intercepting pattern.

Q You want to minimize development cost by reusing methods? Which design pattern would you choose?
- The delegation pattern is a design pattern in OOP where an object, instead of performing one of its stated tasks, 
delegates that task to an associated helper object.

Q You want to avoid multiple inheritance. Which design pattern would you choose?
- Player Role Pattern

Q Facade pattern promotes weak coupling between subsystem and its clients?
- It is one of the patterns benefit. The facade pattern shields clients from subsystem classes and reduces the number of objects that clients deal with.
A facade can be a single entry point to each subsystem level. It decouples the subsystem.

Q Which of the following design pattern provides a single class with simplified methods required by the client and delegate the call to those methods for processing the request?
- Facade Pattern (Structural pattern)

Q Which design pattern defines one-to-many dependency among objects?
- Observer pattern defines one-to-many dependency among objects so that when one object changes its state, all its dependents are notified.

Q Which pattern provides centralized request handling mechanism so that all requests are handled by single handler?
- Front Controller pattern

Q Attach additional responsiblities to an object dynamically. It provides a flexible alternative to subclass for extending functionality.
Which among the below design patterns let the user add new functionality to an existing object without altering the structure of the object?
- Decorator

Q Encapsulate a request as an object, parameterize clients with different requests, queue/log requests and support undoable operation.
Which of the following design pattern is data-driven and the action is based on the data provided?
- Command

Q What represents structure and behaviour of the pattern?
- Form

Q What is State pattern?
- In State Pattern, we create objects which represent various states and a context object whose behavior varies as its state object changes. 
Example: Vending machine
The State Pattern is also known as Objects for States.

Q Which among the following design patterns suggests a request to pass through multiple classes but only relevant classes should execute the request?
- Chain of Responsibility Pattern

Q Which of the below design patterns is useful whenever we have to pass data with multiple attributes in a single shot from a client to a server?
- Transfer Object Pattern

Q Which of the following design pattern is used for accessing elements of a collection object sequentially?
- Iterator Pattern

Q Visitor pattern (Behavioral pattern)
- The Visitor Design Pattern should be used when you have distinct and unrelated operations to perform across a structure of objects (element objects). 
That means the Visitor Design is used to create and perform new operations on a set of objects without changing the object structure or classes.
