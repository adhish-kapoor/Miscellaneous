- Bjarne Stroustrup

Q If base class has constructor with arguments, then is it Mandatory for derived class to have constructor and pass args to base class constructor?
- Yes

Q References vs Pointers
- References are an alias for a variable but pointer stores the address of a variable.
- A reference cannot be made null
- A reference cannot be changed once initialized
- No extra operator is needed for dereferencing of a reference

Q Syntax of class template
- template <parameters> class declaration

- Template class generate objects of classes based on template type
- Template class saves system memory
- Template class helps in making genetic classes

Q Virtual functions?
- The virtual function must be members of some class
- Virtual functions are accessed by using an object pointer
- The virtual function can be a friend of another class
- They must be non-static member function of the class
- They cannot be friends
- Constructor functions cannot be virtual

Q If abstract class is inherited by derived class then ?
- Derived class should provide definition for all the pure virtual functions
- Derived class also becomes abstract if fails to implement pure virtual functions
- Objects of derived class cannot be created if it fails to implement pure virtual functions

Q What are things inherited from base class?
- Constructor and its destructor
- Operator=() members
- Friends

Q What provides facility of using object of a class inside other classes?
- Composition

 NOTE: Composition and aggregation are two types of association which is used to represent relationships between two classes.
 In aggregation, the class is made up of other existing classes that may exist independent of the child class. 
 In composition, the child class depends on its parent for existence.

Q Which is an abstract data type?
- Class is used as an abstract data type as it can be used to give an implementation independent view.

Q Method overriding can be prevented by using the final as a modifier at ?
- the start of method declaration

Q When overloading binary operators using member function, it requires how many args?
- One

Q Non-member function cannot have access to the private data of the class?
- False

Q Which is not a member of the class?
- Friend Function

Q Inline functions are useful when ?
- Function is small and to avoid function call overhead.

NOTE: Inline functions do type checking for parameters
Inline funcs can have return statement

Q Which function must use reference?
- Copy constructor

Q Invoke copy constructor for class TEST ?
- TEST T2(T1)
- TEST T2 = T1

Q An object that represents a useful model of a problem domain is which type of abstraction?
- Entity Abstraction

Q An object that provides a general set of operations, all of which perform the same kind of function is which type of abstraction?
- Action Abstraction

Q An object that groups together operations that are all used by some superior level of control or operations 
that all use some junior-level set of operations is which type of abstraction?
- Virtual Machine Abstraction

Q An object that packages a set of operations that have no relations to each other is which type of abstraction?
- Coincidental Abstraction

Q Property that distinguishes an active object from one that is not active?
- Concurrency

Q A class containing one or more pure virtual functions is known as?
- Abstract class
An abstract class is a class that is declared abstract â€”it may or may not include abstract methods. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, but they can be subclassed.

Q Can we create an object of abstract class type?
- No

Q Can a constructor be virtual?
- No

Q Can a constructor be static?
- No

Q Can a destructor be virtual?
- Yes

Q Which function is not a member of a class but still has access to private data of a class?
- Friend Function

Q State the correct syntax of a friend function.
- Class ABC{
*****
public:
*****
Friend Void xyz(); }

Q Which statement tells the correct difference between Exception and Error?
- Exceptions can be recovered by try-catch blocks, Errors cannot be recovered.

Q Type of inheritance?
- Country --- has capital -----> City
- Hybrid inheritance is the combination of multiple and multilevel inheritances so therefore in the given diagram, lecturer, department, the student refers as multilevel inheritance and marks and students refer as multiple inheritances.

Q The syntax is given below shows which type of inheritance?
class A { 
... .. ... }; 
class B: public A { 
... .. ... }; 
class C: public B { 
... ... ... };

- Multilevel inheritance

Q Which operator is used to access the static variable and static function of a class?
- Scope Resolution Operator (::)

Q The scope resolution operator is used to ____ function in the Inheritance.
- Override

Q If there are different sections of an organization such as IT, computer science, Civil, Mechanical, etc. 
Each organization has the same attributes such as student name, roll number, year, etc. which comes under a class Student 
then this comes under which type of inheritance?
- Hierarchical inheritance

Q How many types of functions are there in an object-oriented programming language?
- There are 5 types of functions in Object-oriented programming languages, they are: 
Simple functions, Static functions, Const functions, Inline functions, and Friend functions.

Q The process of taking away or removing characteristics from something in order to reduce it to a set of essential characteristics.
- Abstraction

Q OOPs concept solves problem at implementation level ?
The fields of a class are made read-only or write-only ?
- Encapsulation

Q Access modifiers and scopes in UML class diagram
- Public (+)
- Private (-)
- Protected (#)
- Package (~)
- Derived (/)
- Static (underlined)

2 scopes are:
Classifiers (static members) and instances.

Q Coupling is the degree to which one class knows about another class.

Q Polymorphic class
- A class that declares or inherits a virtual function is called a polymorphic class.

Q If a class C is derived from class B, which is derived from class A, all through public inheritance, then a class C member function can access.
- Protected data in A and B

Q Hybrid Inheritance in C++ which is a combination of Multiple Inheritances and Single Inheritance.
