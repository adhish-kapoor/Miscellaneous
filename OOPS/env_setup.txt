Q What is used for generic programming?
- Templates

Q The member in a class by default is?
- Private

Q What is correct for references?
- References once assigned cannot be changed to refer another variable

Q Which OOPs concept is allowed to reuse the code?
- Inheritance

Q Can constructors be overloaded?

Q What is effect of negative number in field width specifier?
- The values are displayed left justified

Q Const member function does not allow to modify the value of any data member of class?
- True

Q If a class contains static variable, then every object of the class has its copy of static variable?
- False

Q Which is not a type of constructor?
- Friend

Q While redefining a virtual function in derived class, if it prototype is changed then?
- It will be overloaded by the compiler
- Its virtual nature will be lost

Q Father of C++?
- Bjarne Stroustrup

Q If base class has constructor with arguments, then is it Mandatory for derived class to have constructor and pass args to base class constructor?
- Yes

Q References vs Pointers
- References are an alias for a variable but pointer stores the address of a variable.
- A reference cannot be made null
- A reference cannot be changed once initialized
- No extra operator is needed for dereferencing of a reference

Q Syntax of class template
- template <parameters> class declaration

- Template class generate objects of classes based on template type
- Template class saves system memory
- Template class helps in making genetic classes

Q Virtual functions?
- They must be non-static member function of the class
- They cannot be friends
- Constructor functions cannot be virtual

Q If abstract class is inherited by derived class then ?
- Derived class should provide definition for all the pure virtual functions
- Derived class also becomes abstract if fails to implement pure virtual functions
- Objects of derived class cannot be created if it fails to implement pure virtual functions

Q What are things inherited from base class?
- Constructor and its destructor
- Operator=() members
- Friends

Q What provides facility of using object of a class inside other classes?
- Composition

 NOTE: Composition and aggregation are two types of association which is used to represent relationships between two classes.
 In aggregation, the class is made up of other existing classes that may exist independent of the child class. 
 In composition, the child class depends on its parent for existence.

Q Which is an abstract data type?
- Class is used as an abstract data type as it can be used to give an implementation independent view.

Q Method overriding can be prevented by using the final as a modifier at ?
- the start of method declaration

Q When overloading binary operators using member function, it requires how many args?
- One

Q Non-member function cannot have access to the private data of the class?
- False

Q Which is not a member of the class?
- Friend Function

Q Inline functions are useful when ?
- Function is small and to avoid function call overhead.

NOTE: Inline functions do type checking for parameters
Inline funcs can have return statement

Q Which function must use reference?
- Copy constructor

Q Invoke copy constructor for class TEST ?
- TEST T2(T1)
- TEST T2 = T1
