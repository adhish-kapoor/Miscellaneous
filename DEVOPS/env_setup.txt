Q MaaS ?
- Metal as a Service (MAAS) provides complete automation of physical servers for data center operation efficiency on-premises.
It is open-source software and supported by Canonical.

Q Devops vs Agile?
- DevOps is a culture, fostering collaboration amongst all participants involved in the development and maintenance of software. 
- Agile can be described as a development methodology designed to maintain productivity and drive releases with the common reality of changing needs.

Q Ansible
- Ansible has a master but no agents running on the client machines—all functions are performed over SSH protocol.
- Ansible uses YAML syntax. Complex tasks are handled in configuration files called playbooks, and commands can be written in almost any programming language.
- Ansible, the server pushes configurations to the nodes, for instantaneous deployment.

Q Puppet
- Puppet uses its own declarative language (also called domain-specific language, or DSL).
- Puppet, you have to write the configurations in Puppet’s language
- In Puppet, the client pulls configurations from the server.

Q Orchestration
- Orchestration and scheduling tools strive to eliminate silos, streamline processes and automate repetitive tasks 
so that IT departments can move quickly and efficiently. 
While similar to automation, orchestration goes beyond the scope of automation by focusing on workflows or processes rather than simple tasks.
