Q Ansible
- Ansible has a master but no agents running on the client machines—all functions are performed over SSH protocol.
- Ansible uses YAML syntax. Complex tasks are handled in configuration files called playbooks, and commands can be written in almost any programming language.
- Ansible, the server pushes configurations to the nodes, for instantaneous deployment.

Q Puppet
- Puppet uses its own declarative language (also called domain-specific language, or DSL).
- Puppet, you have to write the configurations in Puppet’s language
- In Puppet, the client pulls configurations from the server.

Q Orchestration

so that IT departments can move quickly and efficiently. 
While similar to automation, orchestration goes beyond the scope of automation by focusing on workflows or processes rather than simple tasks.

Q Facter
- Facter is Puppet's cross-platform system profiling library. 
It discovers and reports per-node facts, which are available in your Puppet manifests as variables.

Q Hiera
