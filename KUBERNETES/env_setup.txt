Q What is a Kubernetes volume?

- EmptyDir

Q An abstraction in kubernetes which defines a logical set of pods and a policy to access them.
- Service

Q The Service Type _____________ works only if your cluster is setup to work with a cloud provider.

Q ___________________ is a special namespace that is used for special purposes like bootstrapping a cluster
- Kube-public

Q __________________ is responsible for health check of the pods running on individual nodes
- Kubelet

Q As soon a service starts, .......... daemon running on each node add a set of environment variables on the pod for each active service.
- Kubelet

Q Cronjobs in kubernetes run in
- UTC only

Q To create a new deployment in kubernetes, use the command
- kubectl run

Q _______ manages the assigning nodes to pods depending on resource availability.
- Scheduler

Q Kubernetes uses _______________________ to connect to ouath 2 providers to offload the authentication to external services

Q Following k8s resources do not associate with any namespace.
- PersistentVolumes and Nodes

Q To program additional authentication logic besides available authenticator modules, _______________ can be used.
- Authentication Proxy

Q Watches for newly created Pods that have no Node assigned and selects a node for them to run on ?
- kube-scheduler

Q How can you filter the output of a kubectl command to only show a Pod called “mypod”
- kubctl get pods/mypod

Q Which of the following tools is good for installed Kubernetes in the AWS cloud?
- kops

Q Which of the following is the only stateful component on a Kubernetes Master?
- Cluster store

Q Which of the following is the preferred method of issuing work to Kubernetes?
- Via manifest files in a declarative fashion

Q How are Services linked to Pods?
- Label Selectors 

Q Which component of the Kubernetes Master is responsible for issuing work to Nodes?
- Scheduler

Q You are trying to see the Pods inside of your Kubernetes cluster using kubectl get pods, but you receive an X509 SSL error upon doing so. What is most likely the problem here?
- The certificates in the "cluster" property within your Kubeconfig are missing, or its Base64 is malformed.

Q Which of these Kubernetes resource types would need to be modified to take advantage of the AWS Load Balancer Ingress Controller?
- Ingress and Service

Q Which of these kubectl commands will allow you to switch between Kubernetes namespaces?
- We use --namespace or -n

Q Which of these statements is most correct about the relationship between Kind and the Docker Registry?
- You must create a local Docker registry and link it to the same network as your kind cluster to run local images.

Q Which runtime does Kubernetes use to create and manage its containers?
- containerd is the runtime that Kubernetes, and subsequently, kind, uses to create and manage containers. runc is used explicitly to start containers.

Q Which of these problems does Kind aim to solve best?
- Creating local Kubernetes clusters easily within Docker.
