SUPERVISED and UNSUPERVISED learning 
- Supervised learning means classifying data based on labels.
K-nearest neighbor - Classify unknown data against the closest data that you do know.
Naive Bayes - Used to classify data having predictors independent of each other.

- Unsupervised learning means clustering data. 
Unsupervised learning just tries to create clusters based on what it already sees in the data.
K-means clustering 

- Reinforcement learning can create strategies to better find patterns in the data. A reinforcement system might invent a strategy to encourage customers to purchase something new.

- Regression - To do a regression analysis, data science teams will typically plot their data on an XY diagram. 

BAGGING and STACKING are the ways to create ensembles (group performing together)
- Bagging is when you use several versions of the same ML algorithm with different data sets to improve the prediction power
- Stacking is when you use several different ML algorithms “stacked” on top of each other to improve the predictions.

- BIAS and VARIANCE 
- Bias is the gap between predicted value and actual outcome
- Variance is when the predicted values are scattered all over the place
